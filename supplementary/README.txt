1. simple_adsorbate_db.zip
include 1422 optimized structures of 8 simple adsorbates on various surfaces and their adsorption energies 

2. complex_adsorbate_db.zip
include 1878 optimized sturctures of 41 small to complex adosrbates on Cu,Co,Pd,Rh,Pt,CuCo surfaces and their adsorption energies.
we use 1679 (Cu, Co, Pd, Rh) out of 1878 samples performing interpolation task, remaining 199 samples (Pt, CuCo)for purpose of extrapolation
