checklist:
1. simple_adsorbate_db.zip
include 1422 optimized structures of 8 simple adsorbates on various surfaces and their adsorption energies 

2. complex_adsorbate_db.zip
include 1878 optimized sturctures of 41 small to complex adosrbates on Cu,Co,Pd,Rh,Pt,CuCo surfaces and their adsorption energies.
we use 1679 (Cu, Co, Pd, Rh) out of 1878 samples performing interpolation task, remaining 199 samples (Pt, CuCo)for purpose of extrapolation

3. we provide some pre-defined ML tasks for the purpose of tutorial and data reproducing, please follow the instruction on the main page and
you are referred to our paper for detailed explanation of the tasks and their setting.
